# About

Development and deployment of an innovative Crop
Recommendation System leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks to assist farmers in making informed crop selection decisions.The system incorporates sensor data, including temperature, humidity, pH values, and soil nutrient content, collected from sensors in agricultural fields. This real-time data acquisition enables precise environmental and soil parameter analysis for accurate crop
recommendations.
